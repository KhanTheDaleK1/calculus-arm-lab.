# Gemini Project: CalculusArm Dynamics Lab

This document provides a guide for interacting with the `CalculusArm Dynamics Lab` project using Gemini.

## Project Overview

The CalculusArm Dynamics Lab is an educational robotics platform for exploring calculus and trigonometry using a 3-axis robotic arm and a smart robot car.

## How to Use

To get started, you can ask Gemini to perform the following tasks:

*   **List files:** "List the files in the `2_calculus-labs` directory."
*   **Read a file:** "Read the contents of the `README.md` file."
*   **Summarize the project:** "Summarize the CalculusArm Dynamics Lab project."
*   **Explain the tech stack:** "What is the tech stack used in the CalculusArm project?"

*This document is intended for use with the Gemini CLI.*
